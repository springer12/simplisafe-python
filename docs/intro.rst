Introduction
============

``simplisafe-python`` (hereafter referred to as ``simplipy``) is a Python3,
``asyncio``-driven interface to the unofficial SimpliSafe™ API. With it, users can
get data on their system (including available sensors), set the system state,
and more.

**NOTE:** SimpliSafe™ has no official API; therefore, this library may stop
working at any time without warning.

**SPECIAL THANKS:** Original inspiration was obtained from
https://github.com/greencoder/easysafe-python; thanks to Scott Newman for all the
hard work!
